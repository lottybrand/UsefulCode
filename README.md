# UsefulCode
I have no idea if this will actually ever be useful to anyone, but just in case. 

I've been making this collection of "useful code" chunks since my PhD. Most of it wasn't written by me and was taken from StackOverflow

A lot of it is clunky, there are basically no functions (I still cannot write my own functions) 

There is NO TIDYVERSE. Sorry not sorry, I just spent a LOT of time getting my head around Base R during my PhD and then all of a sudden you lot come along with your tidyverse stuff and start taking over the world and expect me to just RELEARN everything? Sorry not happening. (It's possible that SOME tidyverse slipped in there without me realising? i actually have no idea tbh)

So in that sense it's probably useless to lots of people unless your hardcore BaseR, and most of you learnt R before me so this will all be too basic for you. But whatever. 

Maybe there are some newbies out there/ people from my R-learning gen that this will help. 

Apologies for the inevitable expletives in the comments, this is raw trial and error code. 

It starts from the very scratch, and goes all the way to a multi level binomial model in Rethinking. 

Some horrendous ggplots are included too. 

It *MIGHT* be quicker to skim this for some code than google stackoverflow. But, my neverending advice to any newbie reading this is FOR GOD'S SAKE GOOGLE IT AND READ THE STACKOVERFLOW ANSWER. 

Peace and Love.
